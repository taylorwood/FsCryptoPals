# FsCryptoPals

Some of my solutions to the [CryptoPals Challenges](https://cryptopals.com). There are accompanying blog posts for [Set 1](https://taylorwood.github.io/2016/10/21/cryptopals-pt1.html) and [Set 2](https://taylorwood.github.io/2016/10/23/cryptopals-pt2.html).

>This is a different way to learn about crypto than taking a class or reading a book. We give you problems to solve. They're derived from weaknesses in real-world systems and modern cryptographic constructions. We give you enough info to learn about the underlying crypto concepts yourself. When you're finished, you'll not only have learned a good deal about how cryptosystems are built, but you'll also understand how they're attacked.
